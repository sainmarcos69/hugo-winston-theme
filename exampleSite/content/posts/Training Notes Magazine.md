#  I am a back-up for this task, but I still need these notes as a reference. See my previous short-cut notes on the instructions. 

# Magazine duty
- [ ] Collect magazines (black mesh basket on my workstation). They  will be checked in manually and changed to non-circulating under the Details tab.
- [ ] Exchange old ones with new issues. New magazines have a plastic protective sleeve to be displayed.
- [ ] New magazines are displayed, the past issues go underneath.
- [ ] Kids magazines are displayed in the kids area (wall), and when check them in do not check the box "non-circulating"  → the new issues are ok to be checked out by customers, so do not check the box non-circulating in Leap when checking these magazines in. 
- [ ] New adult and teen magazines need to be check in “non-circulating” – for older issues uncheck the box "non-circulating” so the become available for customers to check them out. Note: the Exception is the AARP bulletins that live next to the newspapers; the lates issue can circulate so only check it in and don't do the “non-circulating”
Magazines are displayed in alphabetical order.
- [ ] Old magazines – weed after a year and donate them (if in good condition) to FOL store.

## The Consumer Reports magazines don't circulate and they are to be kept by the Service Desk in a white binder.
## There is a printed list of the 2025-2026 magazine collection in my workstation. 
## These magazines are displaying but we won't be getting new issues: Action, Forbes, Outside, and Surfer's Journal.
## These new magazines were added to the collection:
   ###  Adults: Kiplinger Personal Finance and Woman's Day
   ###  Kids: Looney Tunes
   ### Teens: Girl Life, Batman, and Miles Morales spider-Man

## Magazines should be treated like mail and sent back to their branch in interoffice envelopes. They can be damaged if they are put in the totes and also get tangled up in the AMH when emptying the totes into the machine.

## If you need to contact the SDCL Magazine team for questions this is their email → sdcl.magazines@sdcounty.ca.gov  (example: you received a magazine and you are not able to check it in because its barcode does not match any records)

## There are some magazines that we get for free from headquarter; they majority we paid from our branch budget.
